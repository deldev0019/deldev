			<h2 class="section__title section__title--about">Who I am</h2>
			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about"> RPI student studying Game Design/Computer Science Major born and raised out of Westchester </p>

			<div class="about-me__body">
				<p> My cliche backstory is not finding myself fitting in with the general cowrd, a social outcast so to speak, or maybe I'm being dramatic. In either case, I can't deny that videogames have always been a source of entertaintment, even if in the grandscheme of things, I don't really think I played all that many.</p>

				<p> Videogames and the internent were big parts of my life growing up, and my natural curoisity was something that helped me to get in touch with both, as if there was something in a videogame that intrested me, I would look it up on the internent, before getting sucked into the rabbit hole that it is and come out with far more knowleadge than I originally desired. Eventually it all culmanated in my desire to actually create videogames, to actually be involved with the process as I really didn't have anything else that instrested me in a carrer.</p>

				<p> So, here I am now, currently enrolled in college atempting to get a dual major in Game Design and Computer Science, Game Design for obvious reasons, and CS due to my belief of programing being the best option for me to achieve my dream and just seems like a useful skill to have. How well I've done can be up for debate, there have been classmates how's skills leave me in awe, where I can't help but feel inferior. But I know I've come far since I first started, I've learend a lot, and I know I can pull my weight, I may not have a natural talent, but I do believe I have the motivation and drive to work hard and get the job done as best I can.</p>

			<a href="https://dennischen.itch.io/identity-seeker" class="nav__link">"Identity Seeker"</a>
			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--services">Based on the question, "Who am I?" the game gives you a time limit to play 3 genres of game with random elements, giving you the decision of what to play and how long to play it. I worked with Wenfei Peng and Dennis Chen, on this project and focused on the Game Design and concept along with most of the coding for the main menu, timer, and drawing minigame.</p>

			<a href="https://leithalweapon.itch.io/bugged" class="nav__link">"Bugged"</a>
			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--services">Based on the theme, "Chaos", what defines a game? My group argued rules, more so rules in the code. So what happens when code that should work one way fails and presents another option? Well the way to progress turns out to be intresting. Working with Brianna Geck, Paul Nho, Nick Paterno, Leith Reardon, Larissa Truesdell, I was one of the lead game designers, and worked on several of the mechanics used throughout the game.</p>

			<a href="https://teammix.itch.io/game-select" class="nav__link">"Game_Select"</a>
			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--services">Play as a pixal that must travel between several genres of game to different the bugs ruining it and restore the game to its proper state. Along with Brianna Geck, Ryan Hunt, Jon Lafuente, Sebastian Martinez, Carl Maulfair, Wenfei Peng, I worked as one of the lead game designers, helping to come up with the concept of traveling through multiple genres with similar characters to showcase the difference each genre provides. I also worked as the lead programmer for the Enemy AI in the platformer, shooter, and RPG overworld. </p>

			<h3 class="section__title section__title--work">This Website</h3>
			<p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--services">Using this <a href="https://youtu.be/_xkSvufmjEs">tutorial</a> to follow along, I was able to learn a decent amount of html to code this website despite not being that familiar with it save for a summer course back when I was in high school. While this tutorial did help me make a lot of this website, I believe it also showcases my ability to learn and make an effort to search and try new skills for myself. While I could've attempted to use a website builder such as squarespace or wix, which may have helped make this website neater, I believe that coding it myself better demenstrats my ability and character.</p>
